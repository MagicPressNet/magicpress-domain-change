The Domain Change by MagicPress allows you to easily change your website domain or protocol.

== Description ==

Domain Change by MagicPress facilitates the migration of your WordPress site to a new domain.

WordPress stores your website URL in the database multiple times. When changing domains, a search and replace in the database isn't always enough as WordPress serializes options and meta (which often include your site URL).

This is where Domain Change by MagicPress comes in. It searches the database (including serialized objects) for your current domain, or a domain you enter, and replaces it with a new one upon request, updating serialized objects at the same time.

Note: Domain Change by MagicPress is very useful even if you are only changing the protocol, e.g. from HTTP to HTTPS.

1. Install Domain Change by MagicPress either via the WordPress.org plugin repository or by uploading the files to your server. 
2. Activate Domain Change by MagicPress.
